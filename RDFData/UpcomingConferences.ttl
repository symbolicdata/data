Key focuses include both classical and emerging sub-disciplines of computer algebra, such as hybrid symbolic-numeric computation, exact linear algebra, algebraic complexity, polynomial factorization, and sparse interpolation. Besides presenting the latest results, MICA 2016 will assess these achievements and their impacts to other subjects, in the hope of identifying promising future research directions. <br/> We invite submissions of abstracts for contributed talks and posters for MICA 2016. We solicit talks on recent research or surveys of the historical development of sub-areas, with a preference to topics connected to Erich Kaltofen's life-long research interests. We also encourage submissions from all areas of computer algebra and related scientific fields." ;

The two communities share many central interests, but researchers from these two communities rarely interact.  Also, the lack of common or compatible interfaces of tools is an obstacle to their fruitful combination. Bridges between the communities in the form of common platforms and road-maps are necessary to initiate an exchange, and to support and direct their interaction. The aim of this workshop, along the SC-square H2020 FETOPEN Coordination and Support Activity project, is to provide a time to discuss, share knowledge and experience across both communities.
