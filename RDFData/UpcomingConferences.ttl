The aim of the meeting is to discuss current and future applications of computational algebra in mathematics, with a particular focus on geometry. The first day (Tuesday 18th) will be geared more towards young researchers, with a series of expository lectures, hands-on practical sessions, and short talks by graduate students. The main workshop will then run from Wednesday 19th to Friday 21st April." ;

Symbolic methods are increasingly finding a wide variety of applications in and around programming languages.

Also, the lack of common or compatible interfaces of tools is an obstacle to their fruitful combination.  Bridges between the communities in the form of common platforms and road-maps are necessary to initiate an exchange, and to support and direct their interaction. The aim of this workshop, along the SC-square H2020 FETOPEN Coordination and Support Activity project, is to provide a time to discuss, share knowledge and experience across both communities. <br/> The workshop is open for submission and participation to everyone interested in the topics, whether they are members or associates of the SC-square H2020 FETOPEN CSA project or not." ;

These methods have already seen applications in: biology, coding theory, cryptography, combustion, computational geometry, computer graphics, quantum computing, control theory, geometric design, complexity theory, machine learning, nonlinear partial differential equations, optimization, robotics, and statistics. <br/> We welcome participation from both theoretical mathematical areas and application areas not on this list which fall under this broadly interpreted notion of algebraic geometry and its applications." ;

The choice of the topic is motivated by the belief of the organizers that the dialogue between the two communities is very necessary for accelerating the progress in making the computer a truly intelligent aid for mathematicians and engineers." ;

Besides talks about new and improved algorithms and their applications in arithmetic geometry, we will also have presentations by developers of some of the major computer algebra systems and libraries used in arithmetic geometry about recent functionality and future plans. There will be ample time for discussions and collaboration and for trying out and developing new functionality." ;
