The aim of the meeting is to discuss current and future applications of computational algebra in mathematics, with a particular focus on geometry. The first day (Tuesday 18th) will be geared more towards young researchers, with a series of expository lectures, hands-on practical sessions, and short talks by graduate students. The main workshop will then run from Wednesday 19th to Friday 21st April." ;

Symbolic methods are increasingly finding a wide variety of applications in and around programming languages.
