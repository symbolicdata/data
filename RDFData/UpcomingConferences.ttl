Symbolic methods are increasingly finding a wide variety of applications in and around programming languages. Starting from their immensely successful use in generation of numerical codes, their applicability is widening to both code analysis (often through abstract interpretation) and even in certain phases of compilers themselves, as exemplified in recent probabilistic programming languages. <br/> This session will bring together experts in symbolic computation along with programming languages experts to exchange ideas on the state of the art in this domain.

It is broadly concerned with algorithms, their complexity and their embedding in larger logical systems. At the algorithmic level, there is the rich interplay along the Numerical/Algebraic/Geometric/Topological axes. At the logical level, there are issues of data organization, interpretation and associated tools. These issues often arise in scientific and engineering computation where we need experimental and case studies to validate or enrich the theory. MACIS is interested in outstanding and emerging problems in all these areas. <br/> The MACIS Conference 2017 is organized by SBA Research." ;
