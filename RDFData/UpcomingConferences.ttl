In recent decades, computer-assisted mathematical discovery has profoundly transformed the strategies used to expand mathematical knowledge. In addition to symbolic and numerical computation, a new trend that shows tremendous potential is the use of novel visualization techniques. The current situation was well summarized by a recent ICMI study: \"The latest developments in computer and video technology have provided a multiplicity of computational and symbolic tools that have rejuvenated mathematics and mathematics education. Two important examples of this revitalization are experimental mathematics and visual theorems.\" " ;

Besides presenting the latest results, MICA 2016 will assess these achievements and their impacts to other subjects, in the hope of identifying promising future research directions. <br/> We invite submissions of abstracts for contributed talks and posters for MICA 2016. We solicit talks on recent research or surveys of the historical development of sub-areas, with a preference to topics connected to Erich Kaltofen's life-long research interests. We also encourage submissions from all areas of computer algebra and related scientific fields." ;

Such properties often allow to design structured algorithms with lower complexity and storage requirements then their general-purpose counterparts.<br/> The aim of the conference is to bring together researchers from different fields to present their results, exchange ideas, develop and improve collaborations.

This workshop is devoted to the 70th birthday of Sergei Abramov (CCAS, Moscow, Russia) whose influential contributions to symbolic methods are highly acknowledged and adopted by many Computer Algebra systems. <br/> The purpose of this workshop is to present some recent developments in the area of symbolic summation and symbolic integration, ordinary differential equations, difference equations, partial differential equations  and their applications in combinatorics, number theory, particle physics, etc.  It is also to highlight the current state of the art in both - complexity analysis of summation and integration algorithms, and improvements in the complexity of aforementioned algorithms." ;
