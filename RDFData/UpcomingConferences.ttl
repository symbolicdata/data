The two communities share many central interests, but researchers from these two communities rarely interact.  Also, the lack of common or compatible interfaces of tools is an obstacle to their fruitful combination. Bridges between the communities in the form of common platforms and road-maps are necessary to initiate an exchange, and to support and direct their interaction. The aim of this workshop, along the SC-square H2020 FETOPEN Coordination and Support Activity project, is to provide a time to discuss, share knowledge and experience across both communities.
