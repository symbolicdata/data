The SD data store

The master branch of the SD data store is used for backup of the RDF data
provided with our RDF Store at http://symbolicdata.org/Data and also the
resources stored in our central repository.

For more information see
http://wiki.symbolicdata.org/Main_Page

-------------------------------------
OtherResources 

Resources in tool specific formats widely used by the special CA subcommunity.

~/TestSets - TestSet collection in the Normaliz format.

-------------------------------------
RDFData   

Resource Descriptions in RDF turtle format.

-------------------------------------
XMLResources

Resources stored in XML-based format. XML is used to markup semantically
important pieces of the data. The markup is (syntactically) described using
XSchema. See http://wiki.symbolicdata.org for a semantic description of the
meaning of the markup sections within the specific data model of the given
collection.

FreeAlgebras - Systems of noncommutative polynomials over Z given as lists of
       	       ncpolys wrt. a dedicated list of variables.

GAlgebras - Free Algebras with dedicated commutator relations.

GeoProofSchemes - Geometry theorem proof schemes given as geometry straight
		  line programs

IntPS, ModPS - Polynomial systems over Z or finite fields given as lists of
       	       polynomials wrt. a dedicated list of variables.
